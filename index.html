            <p>
              As you stand on the sandy shore and gaze out at the vast expanse
              of the ocean, you are immediately struck by the beauty of the
              beach view before you. The shimmering turquoise water stretches
              out to the horizon, interrupted only by occasional playful waves
              that dance and frolic in the sunlight.

            <h5 class="day-night">An amazing night view</h5>
            <p>
              As the sun sets on the horizon, the beach view transforms into a
              captivating and mystical scene. The sky is painted with a medley
              of warm oranges, pinks, and purples, as the last rays of light
              fade away. The ocean is cloaked in darkness, save for the
              occasional shimmer of moonlight reflecting off the waves. The
              beach is illuminated by soft, golden lights, casting long shadows
              across the sand.

            <h5 class="day-night">glamarous sunset-view</h5>
            <p>
              The soft, powdery sand stretches out beneath your feet, inviting
              you to take a leisurely stroll or simply lie back and soak up the
              sun. A light breeze carries the salty scent of the sea and the
              gentle sound of the waves lapping at the shore, soothing your
              senses and creating a feeling of peace and serenity.
